# Overview

Identify a real-world problem that can be addressed using regression analysis or classification. Choose a specific target to predict and identify relevant features that influence this target. Then apply both machine learning techniques to model and predict the outcomes using Python and scikit-learn. 

# Instructions

## Problem Identification

Select a real-world problem where regression or classification analysis can be applied.
Define the target variable you aim to predict.
Identify and list the features (independent variables) that you believe can influence your target variable.

## Data Collection

Gather or create a dataset that includes your target variable and the selected features.
The dataset should be sufficiently large to enable meaningful training and testing of your models.
Ensure data quality and relevance to the problem.

## Model Development

Choose the right model from scikit-learn.
Train the models using the training dataset.

## Model Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of both models on the testing dataset.
Compare the performance and discuss the suitability of each model for your problem.

## Documentation and Code Submission

Document your analysis, code, and findings in a clear and structured format.
Include comments in your code for better understanding.
